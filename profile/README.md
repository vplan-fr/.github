## Hi there 👋

[vplan.fr](https://vplan.fr/)

## Where is the repository of the vplan.fr-website?
We have a strong commitment to open source, sadly we felt obligated to change the visibility of the vplan.fr-website-repo to private because it currently contains data of concern under data protection law.
To resolve this, we plan to do some git-wizardry to remove any trace of this data. However, that is always painful due to merge conflicts, etc. We hope you understand.
